<p>The HTML code presents a set of personalized cards featuring information about me. Each card includes dynamic content updated via JavaScript, such as unique avatar images, my name, biography, social media links, icons related to UI design and web development, My age is displayed alongside a diamond symbol, and a section for random facts fetched from an external API on the fourth card. The cards are structured within container sections, with both front and back sides that toggle visibility on click. The use of elements are supported by clear annonations to provide the reader of my code clearness, context and logic.</p>

<p>The code enables flipping articles/cards upon click events. It iterates through all the articles on the page, adding event listeners to each one. When an article is clicked, it toggles the "flip" class on the clicked article. Additionally, it ensures that only the clicked article's back content is displayed while others are hidden.</p>

<p>The fetchData() function asynchronously fetches data from a JSON API endpoint (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AliAhmed205/web-app-from-scratch-2324/main/docs/scripts/about.json). Once the data is fetched successfully, it updates the content of each card element on the page based on the retrieved data. Each card represents different information about Ali, including name, bio, socials, and avatar. </p>

<p>The fetchRandomFacts() function fetches random facts from an external API (https://api.api-ninjas.com/v1/facts). It accepts a limit parameter to specify the number of facts to fetch. The retrieved facts are then displayed on the page within an element with the ID "factElement."</p>

<p>The code includes error handling for both fetching data from the JSON API and the external API. If there's an error in fetching data, appropriate error messages are logged to the console.</p>

<p>Overall, this code facilitates an interactive and dynamic user experience by flipping articles/cards, fetching and displaying data from JSON and external APIs, and handling errors effectively. It provides users with an engaging way to explore information about me and discover interesting facts.</p>

<p>The design journey of Deck of Ali began with conceptual sketches, which were then translated into digital mockups using Figma. These mockups not only visualize the layout and aesthetics of the web app but also include annotations indicating potential HTML elements such as images (img), paragraphs (p), and sections. For a detailed breakdown of each stage of the design process, including insights into decision-making, challenges faced, and lessons learned, please refer to my comprehensive design process document. This document provides an in-depth exploration of the journey from concept to realization, offering valuable insights for fellow designers and enthusiasts alike.</p>
