<h1>🃏<b>Welcome to Web app from Scratch</b>🃏</h1>
On the first day of the Web Design & Development minor, we collectively began with an introduction and a 'Race to the Finish' game. Subsequently, we had to choose our skill level and join the corresponding group. 

<b>So what's the assigment ?</b> 

As students, we'll construct a web application, prioritizing the use of HTML, CSS & JavaScript over external resources like libraries and frameworks. Our goal is to create a modular, single-page web app (SPA) tailored to our skill levels and learning objectives. We'll fetch data from an external API, manipulate it for display, and apply familiar patterns in building and testing both our "individual web app" and our team "Web App". Through this process, we'll gain valuable insights into data management, algorithms, and the fundamentals of web development. Based on everyone's prior knowledge, groups were formed. Within my group, I proposed a concept centered around using a deck of cards to represent our team. Each card would hold data to be incorporated into our forthcoming .JSON file.

<b>What sort of data would we aim to fetch?</b>
</h2>

<p align="left">
Good question! We weren't so sure either...

Still, we quickly grabbed a piece of paper and set out to brainstorm a range of subjects that could be used to represent ourselves.
As we began writing down our details like names, ages, and social media handles, we realizedthat we could integrate our developer expertise into the mix.
So instead of your obvious choices like: Facebook, Instagram and X, we went for <b>Discord, Linkedin and GitHub</b>. Instead of a stock image-y of ourselves, we either generated/designed our own avatars or made use of our digital memoji-selves.

<p>🃏 Age</p>
<p>🃏 Avatar</p>
<p>🃏 Socials (Like Discord, GitHub and Linkedin)</p>
<p>🃏 Name</p>
